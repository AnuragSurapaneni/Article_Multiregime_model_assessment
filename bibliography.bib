	abstract = {High-ﬁdelity Large Eddy Simulations (LES) are performed to study the eﬀect of hydrogen injection on a lean turbulent CH4/Air premixed ﬂame. An Analytically Reduced Chemistry (ARC) mechanism is used to achieve a detailed description of CH4/Air-H2 chemistry. First, a validation of this kinetic scheme against the detailed GRI-Mech 3.0 mechanism is presented considering both simpliﬁed and complex transport properties. When hydrogen is added to the mixture, large variations of the mixture Prandtl and of the N2 Schmidt numbers are observed depending on the local species concentration, features that are missed by simpliﬁed models. LES is then applied to study the structure and stabilization mechanisms of a lean (φ = 0.8) premixed CH4/Air swirled ﬂame enriched with hydrogen by using diﬀerent transport modeling strategies. First, the fully premixed CH4/Air case is considered and results are found to validate the LES approach. In agreement with experiments, a classical V-shape ﬂame is stabilized in the low-velocity region near the ﬂame holder created by a central recirculation zone (CRZ). Then, hydrogen enrichment is achieved injecting 2\% of the CH4 thermal power with a central fuel injection lance. Both premixed and diﬀusion ﬂame branches are present in this case, impacting ﬂame stabilization and angle. The ﬂame root the main premixed ﬂame stabilized by a diﬀusion ﬂame kernel created by the injected hydrogen reacting with the oxygen in excess of the premixed stream. Moreover, the H2 consumed with the remaining oxygen in burnt gases leads to the formation of a second ﬂame branch inside the CRZ which is responsible of an increase of the ﬂame angle. Given the high concentration of hydrogen, an impact of the molecular transport models is observed on the ﬂame lift-oﬀ height highlighting the importance of using complex transport properties in any LES involving hydrogen combustion.},

	abstract = {Recently, the relevance of tangential diffusion effects has been identiﬁed for laminar ﬂames. These effects are not considered in the classical ﬂamelet equations. In the present work, ﬂamelet equations including these effects are derived, and their relevance is investigated by a multi-scale asymptotic scaling analysis. The analysis yields characteristic ratios dependent on the local curvature of the mixture fraction ﬁeld, the scalar dissipation rate, and the ﬂame thickness, which indicate whether tangential diffusion effects become important. By comparing relevant scales, a regime diagram is developed and three different ﬂamelet regimes are identiﬁed. In regime I, the classical ﬂamelet equations are valid. In regime II, differential diffusion of species and temperature in ﬂame-tangential direction becomes relevant. In regime III, additional transport along mixture fraction isosurfaces exhibits an inﬂuence on the ﬂame structure. In the latter case it is not sufﬁcient to condition species mass fractions and temperature on the mixture fraction alone since these quantities are not represented by a one-dimensional structure.},

	volume = {34},
	issn = {15407489},
	abstract = {Tabulated chemistry is a popular technique to account for detailed chemical eﬀects with an aﬀordable computational cost in gaseous combustion systems. However its performances for spray combustion have not completely been identiﬁed. The present article discusses the chemical structure modeling of spray ﬂames using tabulated chemistry methods under the hypothesis that the chemical subspace accessed by a two-phase reactive ﬂow can be mapped by a collection of gaseous ﬂamelets. It is shown that tabulated chemistry methods based either on pure premixed ﬂamelets or on pure non-premixed ﬂamelets fail to capture the structure of spray combustion. The reason is the complexity of the chemical structure of spray ﬂames which exhibits both premixed-like and non-premixed-like reaction zones. To overcome this issue, a new multi-regime ﬂamelet combustion model (called Partially-Premixed Flamelet Tabulation 2PFT) is presented in this paper. Information from premixed, partially-premixed and diﬀusion ﬂames are stored in a 3-D look-up table parametrized as a function of the progress variable Yc, describing the progress of the reaction, the mixture fraction Yz, denoting the local equivalence ratio, and the scalar dissipation v*, which identiﬁes the combustion regime. The performances of the 2PFT method are evaluated on counterﬂow laminar spray ﬂames for diﬀerent injection conditions of droplet diameter, liquid volume fraction and velocity. The 2PFT tabulation method better describes the chemical structure of spray ﬂames compared to the classical techniques based on single archetypal ﬂamelets. These results also conﬁrm that the chemical structure of laminar spray ﬂame can be modeled by a multi-regime ﬂamelet combustion model based on gaseous ﬂamelets.},

A quasi-DNS database of the compositionally inhomogeneous partially premixed Sydney/ Sandia flame in configuration FJ-5GP-Lr75-57 is used to directly compare different types of flame regime markers from literature. In the simulation of the flame, detailed chemistry and diffusion models are utilized and no turbulence and combustion models are used as the flame front and flow are fully resolved near the nozzle. This allows evaluating the regime markers as a post-processing step without modeling assumptions and directly comparing regime markers based on gradient alignment, drift term analysis and gradient free regime identification. The goal is not to find the correct regime marker, which might be impossible due to the different set of assumptions of every marker and the generally vague definition of the partially premixed regime itself, but to compare their behavior when applied to a resolved turbulent flame with partially premixed characteristics.},

The model developed for fuel injection is validated against measurements in a non-evaporating spray in a quiescent atmosphere, while the evaporation model accuracy is discussed from results obtained in the case of evaporating isolated droplets.

	abstract = {Flamelet combustion models typically assume that burning occurs in either a fully premixed or a fully non-premixed mode. These assumptions tend to limit the applicability of the models to single-regime combustors. Efforts aimed at reducing this limitation have introduced multi-regime approaches that account for different types of mixing and chemistry interactions. In this study a multi-regime model is applied to two laminar n-heptane ﬂames in an effort to characterize the capabilities and limitations of the approach. Both a 2-D laminar triple ﬂame and a 2-D laminar counter-ﬂow diffusion ﬂame are numerically simulated using the multi-regime model. Data for comparison is generated by additionally simulating the ﬂames using ﬁnite rate chemistry, a purely premixed ﬂamelet model, and a purely non-premixed ﬂamelet model. Simulations demonstrate that the multi-regime approach functions as desired, and tends to access ﬂamelets from the appropriate regime under both non-premixed and premixed conditions. Some important differences between the ﬂamelet solutions and ﬁnite rate solution are observed, however. These differences are caused by the ﬁnite rate solution deviating away from the assumed ﬂamelet manifolds, rather than by inadequate regime predictions. In the analyses of these simulations, an emphasis is placed on understanding the formation of the pollutant species NO. It is shown that even when the local combustion regime is correctly predicted, small deviations from an assumed ﬂamelet manifold can lead to changes in the NO production rate. The simulation results conﬁrm that multi-regime ﬂamelet models are applicable to a wide variety of reacting ﬂows, but the results also help to characterize the limitations of these models.},

	abstract = {High-fidelity large eddy simulations (LES) are conducted for lean natural gas flames with different levels of hydrogen enrichment in a technically premixed swirl-stabilized combustor (PRECCINSTA) operated at atmospheric pressure. The modelling approach relies on tabulation of premixed flamelets and presumed-shape probability density functions (PDF) to account for subgrid turbulence-chemistry interactions. Results are presented for non-reacting and reacting conditions with 0, 40 and 50\% hydrogen content in the natural gas. The influence of hydrogen-enrichment is investigated here by combining LES with Raman measurements. The assessment of LES shows good predictions of the flame stabilization mechanism, flow field and flame dynamics as compared to experiments. The natural gas flame develops a self-excited flow oscillation characterized as a precessing vortex core, which is well reproduced by the LES. The lean operation of the burner with natural gas shows a stable Mshape flame that transitions to a V-shape fully attached flame as the main fuel is blended with hydrogen. Raman measurements are compared with LES data to examine the flame structure and burning characteristics. It is concluded that hydrogen addition makes the flame more compact, induces higher reactivity of the fuel-air mixture and leads to a stable V-shape flame fully attached to the burner’s nozzle-cone.},

Even though significant mixture fraction fluctuations are observed, only small impact of the non-perfect premixing is found on the flow field and flame dynamics. Subsequently, the effect of heat loss to the walls is assessed assuming perfectly premixing. The adiabatic baseline case is compared to heat loss simulations with adiabatic and non-adiabatic chemistry tabulation. The results highlight the importance of considering the effect of heat loss on the chemical kinetics for an accurate prediction of the flow features. Both heat loss simulations significantly improve the temperature prediction, but the nonadiabatic chemistry tabulation is required to accurately capture the chemical composition in the reacting layers.},

	abstract = {Recent experimental studies of a piloted turbulent jet burner at Sydney and Sandia with inhomogeneous mixture composition at the inlet have revealed that the flame stability of a partially premixed flame can be significantly increased with a tailored mixture fraction profile at the burner exit. In the present work, large-eddy simulations of this burner are performed with three different levels of mixture inhomogeneity. A multi-regime flamelet model is employed, which accounts for the range of combustion modes found in these flames. The results of the simulations are validated against experimental data for the case with the highest blowoff velocity. Good agreement is observed for velocity, mixture fraction, and temperature fields. The simulations with the multi-regime model provide detailed data of the prevalent combustion regime as well as the heat release. The location of heat release and differences in the combustion modes are analyzed for three cases with different mixture inhomogeneities. The progress variable source term is split up into the individual contributions of the combustion regimes. Substantial differences are found for the contributions of premixed and non-premixed combustion in the different flames as well as the location of the heat release. These results are used to explain the respective flame stabilities. For the inhomogeneous case, which features substantially increased flame stability, hot pilot gases are in contact with reactive mixture directly at the nozzle. Therefore a predominantly premixed zone of strong heat release develops at the jet exit and stabilizes the flame. For both other cases, the heat release at the nozzle is lower leading to smaller blowoff velocities. For the non-premixed case, this is due to air shielding the pilot from the reactive mixture. For the premixed case, the homogeneous mixture issuing from the jet is above the flammability limit and consequently the heat release is diffusion dominated.},

By using a projection of the full set of mass conservation species balance equations into a restricted subset of the composition space, unsteady multidimensional ﬂamelet governing equations are derived from ﬁrst principles, under given hypotheses. During the projection, as in usual one-dimensional ﬂamelets, the tangential strain rate of scalar isosurfaces is expressed in the form of the scalar dissipation rates of the control parameters of the multidimensional ﬂamelet-generated manifold (MFM), which is tested in its ﬁve-dimensional form for partially premixed combustion, with two composition space directions and three scalar dissipation rates. It is shown that strain-rate-induced effects can hardly be fully neglected in chemistry tabulation of partially premixed combustion, because of ﬂuxes across iso-equivalence-ratio and iso-progress-of-reaction surfaces. This is illustrated by comparing the 5D ﬂamelet-generated manifold with one-dimensional premixed ﬂame and unsteady strained diffusion ﬂame composition space trajectories. The formal links between the asymptotic behavior of MFM and stratiﬁed ﬂame, weakly varying partially premixed front, triple-ﬂame, premixed and nonpremixed edge ﬂames are also evidenced.},

	abstract = {Various strategies have been proposed to tabulate complex chemistry for subsequent introduction into ﬂuid mechanics computations. Some of them are grounded on laminar ﬂame calculations, which are useful to seek out key relations linking a few control parameters with relevant species responses. The objective of this paper is to estimate whether approaches based on premixed ﬂamelets (FPI or FGM) can be extended to partially premixed and diffusion ﬂames. Prototypes of nonpremixed laminar and strained counterﬂow ﬂames are simulated using fully detailed chemistry. The conﬁguration studied is a jet of methane/air mixture opposed to an air stream. A set of reference ﬂames is then obtained, to which FPI results are compared. By varying the equivalence ratio of the free stream of methane/air mixture, from stoichiometry up to pure methane, premixed, partially premixed, and diffusion ﬂames are analyzed. When the fresh fuel/oxidizer mixture equivalence ratio takes values within the ﬂammability limits, excellent results are obtained with FPI. When this equivalence ratio is outside the ﬂammability limits, diffusive ﬂuxes across isomixture fraction surfaces lead to a departure between the FPI tabulation and the reference detailed chemistry ﬂames. This is associated mainly with the appearance of a double-ﬂame structure, progressively evolving into a single diffusion ﬂame when the fuel side equivalence ratio is further increased. Using an improved ﬂame index to distinguish between premixed and diffusion ﬂame burning, hybrid partially premixed combustion is reproduced from a combination of FPI and diffusion ﬂamelets.},

	abstract = {The ﬂame index was originally proposed by Yamashita et al. as a method of locally distinguishing between premixed and non-premixed combustion. Although this index has been applied both passively in the analysis of direct numerical simulation data, and actively using single step combustion models, certain limitations restrict its use in more detailed combustion models. In this work a general ﬂamelet transformation that holds in the limits of both premixed and non-premixed combustion is developed. This transformation makes use of two statistically independent variables: a mixture fraction and a reaction progress parameter. The transformation is used to produce a model for distinguishing between premixed and non-premixed combustion regimes. The new model locally examines the term budget of the general ﬂamelet transformation. The magnitudes of each of the terms in the budget are calculated and compared to the chemical source term. Determining whether a ﬂame burns in a premixed or a nonpremixed regime then amounts to determining which sets of these terms most signiﬁcantly contribute to balancing the source term. The model is tested in a numerical simulation of a laminar triple ﬂame, and is compared to a recent manifestation of the ﬂame index approach. Additionally, the model is applied in a presumed probability density function (PDF) large eddy simulation (LES) of a lean premixed swirl burner. The model is used to locally select whether tabulated premixed or tabulated non-premixed chemistry should be referenced in the LES. Results from the LES are compared to experiments.},

Under the assumption of equal diffusivities a coordinate-free formulation of the flamelet structure is given. This assumption is relaxed and flow dependent effects are considered. It is shown that the steady laminar counterflow diffusion flame exhibits a very similar scalar structure as unsteady distorted mixing layers in a turbulent flow field. Therefore the counterflow geometry is proposed to be the most representative steady flow field to study chemistry models and molecular transport effects in laminar flamelets. The conserved scalar model is interpreted as the most basic flamelet structure. Non-equilibrium calculations are reviewed.},

This approach does not require explicit data transfer and is activated automatically at runtime. Two chemistry descriptions, detailed and reduced, are evaluated on two different configurations: laminar counterflow flame and a turbulent swirl-stabilized flame. For single-node calculations, speedups of 2.3x and 7x are obtained for the detailed and reduced chemistry, respectively. Results on multinode runs also show that DLB improves the performance of the pure-MPI code similar to single node runs. It is shown DLB can get performance improvements in both detailed and reduced chemistry calculations.},

The first type of instabilities can be overcome by choosing an interpolation for the unknowns that satisfies the appropriate inf–sup conditions, whereas the dominant convection requires a stabilized formulation in any case. This paper proposes two stabilized schemes of Sub-Grid Scale (SGS) type, differing in the definition of the space of the sub-grid scales, and both allowing to use the same interpolation for the variables σ –u– p (deviatoric stress, velocity and pressure), even in problems where the convection component is dominant and the velocity–stress gradients are high. Another aspect considered in this work is the non-linearity of the viscosity, modeled with constitutive models of quasi-Newtonian type. This paper includes a description of the proposed methods, some of their implementation issues and a discussion about benefits and drawbacks of a three-field formulation.

The GFRI approach allows local reaction zones to be detected and characterized as premixed, dominantly premixed, multi-regime, dominantly non-premixed, or non-premixed flame structures, based on flame markers (mixture fraction, chemical mode, and heat release rate) derived from the experimental data. The statistics of chemical mode zero-crossings, which mark premixed reaction zones, and the relative populations of flame structures are shown to be sensitive to the state of mixing in the near field of the flame and to the level of local extinction farther downstream. Multi-regime structures, where premixed and non-premixed reaction zones occur in close proximity and both contribute to overall heat release, account for nearly half the total population at streamwise locations within the first several jet diameters. There is a rapid transition within the near field whereby the relative population of non-premixed and dominantly non-premixed structures grows from 0.05 to nearly 0.5, and the population of premixed and dominantly premixed structures decreases correspondingly as fluid entering the reaction zone becomes progressively fuelrich. Local extinction and re-ignition bring a resurgence in premixed-type structures, many of which occur at fuel-lean conditions. There are also modest populations of multi-regime structures, having chemical mode zero-crossings at lean conditions, which would not exist in a fully burning jet flame.},

The simulations make use of a low-Mach number Navier-Stokes solver and a thermodynamic pressure evolution model has been implemented to reproduce the pressure variation that may be issued from either experiments or from a standard (i.e., analytical) compression law. Chemistry is described with a representative skeletal mechanism featuring 29 species and 48 elementary reaction steps. The computational results clearly confirm the enhancement of flame propagation in constant volume combustion conditions. The impact of the droplet diameter on the turbulent flame development is scrutinized for two distinct values of the Stokes number St equal to 0.1 and 1.0. Significant influence on the flame dynamics is put into evidence. This is a direct outcome of the equivalence ratio and temperature heterogeneities, which are themselves very sensitive to the choice of the Stokes number value. Then, small-scale turbulence-scalar interactions (TSI) are studied by analyzing the fields of the scalar gradients and strain-rate. Their dynamics is investigated for both non-reactive and reactive two-phase flows conditions. The TSI analysis is performed on the basis of time evolution equations written for quantities that characterize the couplings between the velocity gradient tensor and scalar gradients vectors. Special emphasis is placed on the possible influence of mass exchange terms between the liquid and gaseous phases.},

	abstract = {Injector ﬂow dynamics and primary breakup processes are known to play a pivotal role in determining combustion and emissions in diesel engines. In the present study, we examine the effects of primary breakup modeling on the spray and combustion characteristics under diesel engine conditions. The commonly used KH model, which considers the aerodynamically induced breakup based on the Kelvin–Helmholtz instability, is modiﬁed to include the effects of cavitation and turbulence generated inside the injector. The KH model and the new (KH-ACT) model are extensively evaluated by performing 3-D time-dependent simulations with detailed chemistry under diesel engine conditions. Results indicate that the inclusion of cavitation and turbulence enhances primary breakup, leading to smaller droplet sizes, decrease in liquid penetration, and increase in the radial dispersion of spray. Predictions are compared with measurements for non-evaporating and evaporating sprays, as well as with ﬂame measurements. While both the models are able to reproduce the experimentally observed global spray and combustion characteristics, predictions using the KH-ACT model exhibit closer agreement with measurements in terms of liquid penetration, cone angle, spray axial velocity, and liquid mass distribution for non-evaporating sprays. Similarly, the KH-ACT model leads to better agreement with respect to the liquid length and vapor penetration distance for evaporating sprays, and with respect to the ﬂame lift-off location for combusting sprays. The improved agreement is attributed to the ability of the new model to account for the effects of turbulence and cavitation generated inside the injector, which enhance the primary breakup. Results further indicate that the combustion under diesel engine conditions is characterized by a double-ﬂame structure with a rich premixed reaction zone near the ﬂame stabilization region and a non-premixed reaction zone further downstream. This ﬂame structure is consistent with the Dec’s model for diesel engine combustion (Dec, 1997) [1], and well captured by a newly developed ﬂame index based on the scalar product of CO and O2 mass fraction gradients.},

	abstract = {The intricate coupling between coal pyrolysis, gas phase combustion and the emissions of alkali metal, such as sodium, is studied in the early stage of a temporally evolving three-dimensional planar turbulent jet carrying pulverized-coal particles. Complex chemistry is used to account for both the combustion of volatile hydrocarbons and the sodium containing species. The response of the sodium chemistry is analyzed in the mixture fraction space, along with the topology of the reactions zones. Combustion is found to start preferentially in partially premixed flames, which then evolve toward diffusion-like reactive layers and reach chemical equilibrium. From the direct numerical simulation (DNS) database, the possibility of modeling the dynamics of sodium species using one-dimensional premixed flamelet generated manifolds (FGM) is investigated. A chemical lookup table is constructed for the combustion of the partially premixed volatiles and an additional three-dimensional simulation is performed to compare the tabulated sodium species against their reference counterparts with complex chemistry. Quantitative analysis of the performance of the developed chemistry tabulation confirms the validity of the approach. Perspectives for the modeling of sodium emissions in pulverized-coal furnaces and boilers are finally drawn.},

	abstract = {A computational technique is described and demonstrated that can decrease by three orders of magnitude the computer time required to treat detailed chemistry in reactive ﬂow calculations. The method is based on the in situ adaptive tabulation (ISAT) of the accessed region of the composition space—the adaptation being to control the tabulation errors. Test calculations are performed for non-premixed methane–air combustion in a statisticallyhomogeneous turbulent reactor, using a kinetic mechanism with 16 species and 41 reactions. The results show excellent control of the tabulation errors with respect to a speciﬁed error tolerance; and a speed-up factor of about 1000 is obtained compared to the direct approach of numerically integrating the reaction equations. In the context of PDF methods, the ISAT technique makes feasible the use of detailed kinetic mechanisms in calculations of turbulent combustion. The technique can also be used with reduced mechanisms, and in other approaches for calculating reactive ﬂows (e.g. ﬁnite difference methods).},

	abstract = {This paper reviews recent advances in understanding the structure of turbulent partially premixed and stratiﬁed ﬂames. The term “partially premixed” refers here to compositionally inhomogeneous mixtures that include ﬂammable and non-ﬂammable ﬂuid while “stratiﬁed” combustion refers to a reacting front propagating through a range of compositions within the ﬂammable limits. An overview of relevant laminar ﬂame concepts is ﬁrst introduced. In laminar partially premixed ﬂames, the interaction between rich and lean mixtures is signiﬁcant leading to improvement in the ﬂame’s resistance to extinction by straining. In lean back-supported laminar stratiﬁed ﬂames, the ﬂux of excess heat and radicals into the lean ﬂuid results in higher ﬂame speeds, broader reaction zones, and extended ﬂammability limits compared to homogeneous counterparts. Rich stratiﬁed ﬂames are more complex due to the combined ﬂuxes of heat as well as reactive species such as H2 and CO.},

	abstract = {The utilization of low-dimensional manifold combustion models for large-eddy simulation (LES) of turbulent reactive ﬂows introduces model simpliﬁcations that represent sources of uncertainties in addition to those arising from turbulent closure models and numerical discretization. The ability to quantitatively assess these uncertainties in the absence of measurements or reference results is vital for reliable and predictive simulations of practical combustion devices. This paper is concerned with the extension of the manifold drift term to LES to examine the compliance of a particular combustion model in describing a quantity of interest (QoI) with respect to the underlying ﬂow-ﬁeld representation. This drift term was previously introduced as a key component of the Pareto-efﬁcient combustion (PEC) framework. The behavior of the drift term is examined in a series of test cases. To this end, large-eddy simulations of a partially-premixed turbulent pilot ﬂame with inhomogeneous inlet streams are performed, in which the non-premixed ﬂamelet/progress-variable (FPV) model and the premixed ﬁltered tabulated chemistry LES (F-TACLES) formulation are employed. The drift term is shown to be capable of identifying chemically sensitive regions with respect to user-speciﬁc QoIs. With this, a species-speciﬁc combustion regime indicator is derived by computing the relative magnitude of the drift terms for different combustion models. Comparisons with commonly employed ﬂame indicators suggests that the ﬂame index and other indicators that are solely based on major species and ﬂame topology are insufﬁcient in describing complex physical processes in multi-regime combustion.},

	abstract = {This study presents a systematic analysis of the capabilities of a flamelet model based on Flamelet Generated Manifolds (FGM) to reproduce preferential diffusion effects in partially premixed hydrogen flames. Detailed transport effects are accounted for by including a mixture-averaged transport model when building the flamelet database. This approach adds new terms to the transport equations of the controlling variables in the form of diffusive fluxes where the coefficients can be computed from the information contained in the manifold and saved in the flamelet database. The manifold is constructed from the solution of a set of premixed unstretched adiabatic one-dimensional flames with mixture-averaged transport for a range of mixture fraction within the flammability range. Special attention is given to the numerical aspects related to the construction of the chemical manifold to reduce the numerical error in evaluating the new terms derived from the preferential diffusion of certain species. Finally, a systematic application of the method to simulate laminar hydrogen flames in various canonical configurations is presented from premixed to stratified flames, including the case of a triple flames with different mixing lengths. The results demonstrate that the method describes accurately the flame structure and propagation velocities at a low cost, showing a remarkable agreement with the detailed chemistry solutions for flame structure and propagation velocity.},

	abstract = {Liquid ammonia combustion can be enhanced by co-firing with small molecular fuels such as methane, and liquid ammonia will undergo flash evaporation due to its relatively low saturation pressure. These characteristics, involving the presence of multiple fuel streams, a rapid phase change process, and strong heat loss, pose chal­ lenges for flamelet modeling of liquid ammonia combustion. To address these issues, this study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of flamelet-based models for liquid ammonia combustion in a turbulent mixing layer. Specif­ ically, the extended flamelet/progress variable (E-FPV), extended flamelet-generated manifolds (E-FGM), and extended hybrid (E-Hybrid) models are developed and assessed. Firstly, a three-dimensional Point-Particle Direct Numerical Simulation (PP-DNS) with detailed chemistry is performed, where the turbulent flow is fully resolved, and the ammonia droplets are described by the Lagrangian method, to investigate the combustion characteristics of a liquid ammonia/methane co-fired flame and to provide state-of-the-art validation data for flamelet modeling. The PP-DNS results reveal distinct stages in the liquid ammonia/methane co-fired flame, namely, the mixing, methane-dominated, and fully reacting stages. The phase change process introduces significant heat loss due to the high latent heat of liquid ammonia. Subsequently, flamelet-based models are developed to account for the complex fuel streams, rapid phase change process, and strong local heat loss. The performance of these models is evaluated through a priori analysis by comparing the predictions with the PP-DNS results. The a priori results show that the E-FGM model outperforms the E-FPV and E-Hybrid models. This superior performance can be attributed to the rapid flash evaporation and sufficient mixing of the ammonia vapor and oxidizer, resulting in the dominance of the premixed combustion mode in liquid ammonia combustion.},
